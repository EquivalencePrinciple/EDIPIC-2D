This is a hollow cathode system. The domain is a rectangle, with 8 boundary objects placed along the domain boundary. 
Boundary objects 1,3,5,7 are metal electrodes, boundary objects 2,4,6,8 are vacuum gaps between the electrodes. 
The left (#1) and the right (#5) electrodes are grounded, emit electrons, and are placed opposite to each other. 
These electrodes form the whollow cathode.
The bottom electrode (#7) has potential -20 V, it does not emit electrons.
The top electrode (#3) has potential +80 V, it does not emit electrons.
Neutral Argon gas is present, with elastic, inelastic, and ionization collisions enabled.
External magnetic field {BX,BY} created by a pair of Z-directed wires with opposite electric currents is applied (see init_externalBxBy.dat).

The setup is configured to run with 32 MPI processes.
