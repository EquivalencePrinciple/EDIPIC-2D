This system represents radial-azimuthal cross section of the acceleration region of a Hall thruster. It is periodic along the x direction.
The top and bottom boundaries (#2 and #4) are dielectric walls. They produce secondary electron emission. 
Emission properties approximate that of BN ceramics used in HT stidies with the EDIPIC 1d code.
Ion colliding with walls are 100% adsorbed. 
For the emission properties, see file init_material_BNCER0.dat.
External Y-directed magnetic field (radial) and Z-directed  electric field (axial) are applied.
Neutral gas Argon is present with elastic, excitation, and ionization collisions enabled.

The setup is configured to run with 32 MPI processes.
