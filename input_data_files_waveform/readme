This is an example of a capacitively coupled system. The domain is a box, symmetric relative to plane x=0, bounded on other sides by three metal walls 
with gaps between them. One metal wall (boundary object #2) has harmonically oscillating potential with a bias. Another wall (#4) has 3 segments and is grounded. 
The potential of the wall at the bottom (#6) performs periodic non-harmonic oscillations defined by the waveform data file init_bo_06_waveform.dat .

Note, if the code does not find a waveform file (init_bo_NN_waveform.dat), it assumes that the waveform potential is not applied 
and uses only parameters (bias, harmonic oscillations amplitude, frequency, and phase) from init_bo_NN.dat in order to calculate the potential of boundary object NN.

### Important :: this example is configured to run with 16 MPI processes. ###
