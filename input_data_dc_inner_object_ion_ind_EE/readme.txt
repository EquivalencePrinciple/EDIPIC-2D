This system is a metal box fileld with plasma, with a metal electrode in the middle. 
External walls (boundary objects #1-4) are grounded and do not produce any emission.
The electrode (#5) has potential of -200 V.
The electrode is a new kind of boundary objects, called "inner object".
An inner object may be of rectangular shape only, it can be either metal or dielectric.
In this setup, the inner object has the property of ion induced electron emission enabled, 
see files init_bo_05.dat and init_material_METAL2.dat .
Neutral gas Argon is present with elastic, inelastic, and excitation collisions enabled.

The setup is configured to run on 16 MPI processes.
